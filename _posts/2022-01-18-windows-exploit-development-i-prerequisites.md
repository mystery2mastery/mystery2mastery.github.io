<p>What do I need to learn Windows Exploit Development?</p><div><u><b>Intangible list:</b></u></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>1. The most imp. quality is persistence. <br /></div><div>2.
 Brain - ability to think and make sense of what is happening (Why brain
 is second to persistence? Even if one is not a genius, everything can 
be understood if one persists. With sufficient time everything can be 
done.)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><u><b>Tangible list:</b></u></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>1. <a href="https://understandtruly.blogspot.com/2022/01/windows-internals.html" target="_blank">Windows Internals</a>: A basic understanding of Windows Internals will lay a strong foundation in Windows Exploit Development.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>2. <b>Shellcode development</b>: I hope you are familiar with shellcode development by now.</div><div>&nbsp;<br /></div><div>3. <b>Debugger</b>: I will be using Immunity Debugger exclusively for all my Windows Exploit Development needs. This is simply because of the awesome plugin mona.py which is written for the immunity debugger. It makes exploit development process a breeze. If you don't want to use mona.py for some reason, then you can avoid mona.py and use other tools or write your own tools for that purpose. Infact I started my learning journey when there was no mona.py. Some tools I wrote on my own and some others I borrowed from others. Its upto you.</div><div><br /></div><div>4. An <b>editor </b>or IDE if you prefer &lt;optional&gt;: I use notepad++.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>5. A <b>scripting language</b> of your choice: I use python extensively.<br /></div><br />
