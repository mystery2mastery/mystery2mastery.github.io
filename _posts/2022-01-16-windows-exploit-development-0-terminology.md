<p>Before one enters the world of Windows Exploitation, one needs to be aware of some basic terms and concepts associated with Exploitation in general. Some such terms/concepts are given below:</p><p><span style="color: #04ff00;"><b>1. Vulnerability</b><b>: </b></span>Vulnerability is a potential flaw in the program that may be exploited. However, not all vulnerabilities can be exploited. Some vulnerabilities only lead to a crash and cannot be exploited.<br /></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #04ff00;"><b>2. Payload</b><b>: </b></span>Payload is the malicious data that is sent to a vulnerable program in order to exploit it. There are a wide variety of payloads that achieve various tasks. Ex: Denial of Service (DOS), Privilege Escalation etc.<br /></p><p><span style="color: #04ff00;"><b>3. Shellcode:</b></span> Shellcode is sent as a part of the payload and is responsible for gaining control over the program. Shellcode is usually a position independent code. Not all exploits include shellcode.<br /></p><p><span style="color: #04ff00;"><b>4. Exploit:</b></span> Exploit is a malicious piece of code that successfully 
builds on a vulnerability and modifies the behavior of the program.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on how the payload is delivered, exploits are classified into two types:</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #01ffff;"><b> </b></span></span><span style="color: #01ffff;"><b>i. Local Exploit:</b></span> In these type of exploits, payload is delivered locally i.e., physical access to the computer is required to manually deliver the payload. Note: A remote desktop connection can also be made to the computer and the payload can be delivered locally.<br /></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #01ffff;"><b> </b></span></span><span style="color: #01ffff;"><b>ii. Remote Exploit:</b></span> Here the payload is delivered remotely over the internet (or LAN etc.). Remote exploits are considered more serious as they can be deployed from anywhere.</p><p><br /></p>
